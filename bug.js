function getBalance() {
  const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(address);
  return balance;
}

//The bug is in the above code snippet.  The getBalance function does not handle potential errors during the balance retrieval. If the web3 library encounters an error (e.g., network issues, invalid address), it will throw an exception, causing the application to crash or produce unexpected results.
